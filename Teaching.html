    <!-- Course Policies -->
    <h2>Course Policies</h2>
    <h3>Absence</h3>
    <p>If you miss a class, it is up to you to make up for the lost time. Missing two exams leads to an automatic F in the course. If you miss one exam, you must contact the Dean of Students (DOS) within 2 working days from the day the reason for the absence is lifted with all necessary documentation. If DOS approves, your missing exam grade will be set equal to the average of the non-missing exam grades.</p>

    <h3>Collaboration and External Resources for Assignments</h3>
    <p>Some homework problems will be challenging. You are advised to first try and solve all the problems on your own. You are also allowed to collaborate with your classmates and search for solutions online. But you should use such solutions only if you understand them completely (admitting that you do not understand something is way better than copying things you do not understand). Also, make sure to give the appropriate credit and citation.</p>

    <h3>Late Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> There will be a 10% penalty of total regular points for every day an assignment is late.</li>
        <li> Max. late submission is 7 days late.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please note that it is my professional obligation and responsibility to report any academic misconduct to the Dean of Students Office. Any student found in violation of the code by cheating, plagiarizing or using any online software inappropriately will result in disciplinary action. This may include a failing grade of F, and/or suspension or dismissal from the university. If you have any questions about the code of Academic Integrity, please contact the Dean of Students Office at <a href="mailto:dos@njit.edu">dos@njit.edu</a>.</p>
